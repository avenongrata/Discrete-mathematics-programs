# Discrete-mathematics-programs
A set of programs in discrete mathematics

# General info:
- Designed to run in Windows\Linux
- **Bfs-search** is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph), and explores all of the 
neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
- **The chromatic number** of a graph **G** is the smallest number of colors needed to color 
the vertices of **G** so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color i.e., the smallest value 
of **k** possible to obtain a **k**-coloring.
- **paths_in_graph** program allows you to find 4 possible edge in graph (*tree/back/forward/cross - edge*)
- **transitive_matrix** program allows you to find a transitive matrix from your matrix
